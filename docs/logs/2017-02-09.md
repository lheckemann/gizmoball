# Git shortlog

Linus Heckemann (8):
      Add design so far
      Oops, that wasn't the most recent version
      Partially document model design
      Add draw interfaces and some missing stuff
      Complete diagram, maybe? Hopefully.
      Fix use-case alternate path numbering
      Document physics and triggering, fix layout issues
      report: fix preamble lines

Meggetto Francesco (4):
      Add GUI screenshots
      Correct screenshots
      Project plan
      Merge branch 'master' of https://gitlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/cs308-2016/js8

Unai Zalakain (53):
      Bookmark the specs
      Start distilling the specs
      Today's log
      Today's report
      Complete revised specs
      Merge branch 'master' of ssh://gitlab.cis.strath.ac.uk:23/seb14166/gizmoball
      Explain how rotation works
      Fix typo
      State the user can quit at any time
      Add makefile to compile the documentation
      Reformat for pandoc
      Simplify documentation compilation
      WIP #4: Add `reset()` method to the `BuildModel` interface
      WIP #4: Add load and save methods to the BuildModel interface
      WIP #4: Expose an observable interface on the DrawModel
      WIP #4: Detail how references to the model are kept
      Make both BuildModel and RunModel extend ReadModel
      Add title to the report
      Comment on the top-level part of the design
      Write the rest of the design docs
      Format project plan for pandoc and include in makefile
      Keep a map for key press conns and another for key release conns
      Rephrase the merging part of our project plan :D
      Confine the location of balls to non-overlapping locations
      Document the BuildModel interface
      Boilerplate code for part of the model and gizmos
      Add boilerplace code for balls
      Add model read interfaces
      Add maven build config and physics library
      Solve sparse compilation errors
      Today's group report
      Declara package
      The physics library ain't part of gizmoball
      Map ball identifiers to balls
      Take board width and height as parameters to the model constructor
      Implement `Model.select()`
      Store the selected coordinates instead of the gizmo or ball
      Implement `Model.move()`
      Implement `Model.delete()`
      No need to return the identifier together with the gizmo/ball
      Gravity and friction getters and setters
      addBall and addGizmo will have to take an identifier
      Implement Model.rotateGizmo()
      Implement Model.setBallVelocity
      Implement Model.connectKeyPress and Model.connectKeyRelease
      Add gizmo types as subclasses of Gizmo
      Implement addBall()
      Implement triggerOnOuterWalls and triggerOnGizmo
      Add the RunModel interface
      Have an add* method per gizmo type
      Note that delete() still needs to delete gizmos from trigger mappings
      Implement BuildModel.load
      Throw syntax errors with meaningful messages

William Macdonald (2):
      Implemented save in model
      Added very simple JUnit tests for saving and loading. Need to be improved upon
	  Written initial use cases draft
      Re-written use cases to match format required
      Added more use cases
      Fixed typo
