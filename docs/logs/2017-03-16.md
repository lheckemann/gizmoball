Linus Heckemann (26):
      Fix potentially incorrect scaling of circles
      Only apply gravity once per tick per ball
      Fix circles in triangle gizmo
      Don't save instead of loading
      Space out gizmo-adding radio buttons
      Add ball spawner
      Totally didn't forget to add the new classes
      Add ball sink
      Reduce the madness in BuildView
      Use spinners for numeric values, reduce duplication
      Allow stopping/starting spinning flippers
      Fix angular velocity for stopped spinning flipper
      Deduplicate gizmo-adding code
      Merge branch 'build-mode'
      Prefer removing balls over removing gizmos
      Nicer visuals for spawner and sink
      Allow dragging to add/delete multiple gizmos
      Merge branch 'controller-cleanup'
      Improve alignment on build mode controls
      Remove the red build mode border
      Less contrast on the grid
      Simplify Saver
      pom: fix test path
      Fix gizmo key triggering
      Move GizmoType out of ReadGizmo

Meggetto Francesco (21):
      Better tests for Gimos + commented getRadiansFromNorth as not being used anywhere
      Few fixes + more tests
      A bit of cleanup
      Fix NullPointer on Load/Save and view casting issues
      Merge branch 'build-mode' of https://gitlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/cs308-2016/js8 into build-mode
      Update Board quick fix
      Removed getRadiansFromNorth in Rotation forever. Bye
      Removed setRotation from Gizmo forever. Bye you too
      Spinning Flipper but not yet perfect
      Changed order for UI purposes
      Collision with spinning flipper is better but not fully working
      Right Spinning works now. Collision a bit better
      Fix updateBoard not sometimes being called
      Stop game in build mode
      That's a better way
      SECONDS_PER_TICK in RunModel and not ReadModel
