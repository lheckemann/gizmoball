- Adapt prototypes already written to the common design.

# Unresolved issues

# Plan

- Meet all the requirements for the prototype submission:
    - Update design [Unai]
    - Testing strategy [Francesco]
    - Plan [Linus]
    - Finish prototype 2 [All]
    - Prototype 3 [All]

# Git shortlog

Linus Heckemann (11):
      Adapt prototype 1 to design
      Move everything into gizmoball package
      Merge branch 'prototype-1'
      Remove observers from Model
      Focus RunView on switch rather than initialisation
      Rotate flippers in prototype 1
      Connect flippers to space in prototype 1
      Account for key repeat
      Simplify mode switch
      â™¥ antialiasing
      Draw flippers gud

Meggetto Francesco (8):
      Weekly report 09/02
      Add Francesco's GUI
      Load model, no update yet
      Observer + IModel upper interface
      Ooooook. Bracketing as you like
      Loading flippers without Observer
      Made FlipperView paint() static
      Added initial drawing code for gizmos and balls. Need to fix some bugs

Unai Zalakain (33):
      Split loadCommand into creation and dependent command loaders
      Move tests out of the main src dir
      Change tabs to four spaces, remove trailing space
      Simplify the dumping of connections
      Better to return null if no ID for a gizmo is found
      No need to restrict the rotation of gizmo types here
      Define the number of turns a rotation needs in the Rotation enum
      The output stream needs to be already constructed
      Make the for loops and var names more readable
      Leave some air in the loading methods
      Complete the delete method
      Remove legacy GizmoType from prototype 1
      Represent both left and right flippers by Flipper
      Borrow some view code for the build view
      Add an entry point for prototype four
      If a command is invalid, tell which command it is
      Splitting on \s+ gives an empty string token on empty lines
      Ball creation is not dependent on any other commands
      Restore the original transform after each gizmo is drawn
      Do the same for the run view
      Restore the physics library to its original contents
      Configure maven to create a jar for prototype 2 too
      Merge branch 'prototype-2' into prototype-4
      Remove IModel
      Move ball and gizmo drawing code to its own subpackage
      Make sure methods respond to those declared on the interfaces
      Move prototype-1 launcher out of the model
      Restore original board if load fails
      Reformat and tidy up
      Rename IBoard to GameView and make it a class
      Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/prototype-4'
      More succinct keyPressed and keyReleased
      Clean up a bit

William Macdonald (8):
      Finished rendering of valid save file. Cleaned up some comments, unused imports.
      Fixed rendering issue on mode switching
      Remove prints
      Merge branch 'prototype-4' of https://gitlab.cis.strath.ac.uk/cs308-2016/js8 into prototype-4
      Make it so model resets on load. Needs editing so only resets on valid load
      Added flipper movement rendering
      Fixed listener not being triggered
      Add demo board layout for prototype2
