# Discussions

- MVC architecture proposal:
    - C -> M, M -> V, V -> M
    - C -> M, C -> V, V -> M
- Grid representation
- Common intake for GUI building and config file
- Are declarations guaranteed to come before references? We will handle it
    anyway.

# Plan

- Read the physics engine demo
- Divide into two prototyping groups:
    - Handle loading and saving (M) [unai, william]
    - Rendering and triggering of events (V) [francesco, linus]
- Talk about the design
