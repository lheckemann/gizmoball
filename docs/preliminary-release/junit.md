# JUnit Testing Strategy

## How to identify JUnit test cases

White box: by looking at the source code, we are going to implement
JUnit tests by focusing on complete branch coverage.
Black box: by looking at method specifications, we are going to 
implement JUnit tests that compare the expected with actual 
behaviour. 

## How to approach JUnit testing as a group

Since our group is made up of 4 people, we are thinking
that a good approach would be to create 2 sub-groups of 2 each.
Each sub-group is responsible for creating JUnit tests for one half of
the model each.

Once JUnit tests are ready, sub-group 1 checks sub-group 2's tests
and sub-group 2 checks sub-group 1's tests.
By doing so, we are able to check for missing or wrong test cases.
