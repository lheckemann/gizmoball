# Project Plan

Week 4:
        - Implement common design from class diagram.
          "All"
Week 5: 
        - Finalize prototype #1 and prototype #4 with testing as we build,
          reflecting changes to the design (class diagram).

          "Same teams as week 5"
        - Finalize requirements and documents for Preliminary Release submission.
          "All"
Week 7-8:
        - Start merging prototypes in a single implementation.
          "Initially within the two sub-groups. Near the end, all together"
Week 9:
        - Finalize JUnit tests, if needed.
          "All"
